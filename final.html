      <br> SAN ROQUE PERISH CATHOLIC CHURCH
      <br><span class="read-more"> <img src="images/church1.jpg" alt="" width="300"> <br>An early house of worship was constructed from tabique pampango, nipa, and coral stones that was constructed in 1864. The construction of the stone church began during the term of Fr. Lucas Incon, a secular priest, who served between 1924 and 1933.

        Architecture
        Renovations done throughout the history of the Cordova Church made much of it contemporary in style. It combines architecturally Moorish and Gothic elements.
        
        Its facade is designed as porte-cochere. It has four Corinthian columns that are fluted and topped with peaks made of minor fluted pier and bulbous spire, dividing the facade as well as the pediments into three sections and where the middle section is wider than the other two.
        
        
        On the ground floor is an arcade made of three contiguous arches. Above the arches are clover-shaped windows bearing cherub-like figures. Each of the three pediments is a pointed arch whose outline is embellished with acanthus leaves.
        
        On each pediment is a relief of a particular icon: the center has the coat of arms of the Holy See, the gospel side the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and the epistle side the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
